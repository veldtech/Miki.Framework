	/// Command attributes are notated to show that this asynchronous method is a command that the
	/// bot can execute. Keep in mind if you use the default <see cref="CommandTree"/> this will require
	/// you to encapsulate your current method into a class marked with a <see cref="ModuleAttribute"/>
	/// attribute to be able to be found. Command attributes can be assigned to both methods and types.
	/// However, both targets require different semantics:
	/// - For a method, you need to have an <see cref="IContext"/> as your first argument, and it needs to
	/// return a <see cref="System.Threading.Tasks.Task"/>.
	/// - For a type, you need to either enrich it with additional tasks that are commands. Child-commands
	/// can be empty, but this will be used as the default execution line for the type command. An empty
	/// child command needs to be unique. This execution is recursive-friendly.
